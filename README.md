promises-tests-as3
==================

Porting the [Promises/A+](http://promisesaplus.com/) [test suite](https://github.com/promises-aplus/promises-tests) to ActionScript to support [the CodeCatalyst implementation](https://github.com/CodeCatalyst/promise-as3/issues/11)


Any support is welcome, but I'm still learning about merging in pull requests.

There is also an [ongoing thread](https://github.com/promises-aplus/promises-tests/issues/52) about details of specific tests, it is an interesting read. 

Current status:
